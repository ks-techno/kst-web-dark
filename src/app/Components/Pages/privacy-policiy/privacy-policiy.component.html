                    rights under the GDPR at all times.
                    Our use of your personal data will always have a lawful basis, either because it is necessary for
                    our
                    performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to our use of your personal data
                    (e.g. by
                    subscribing to emails), or because it is in our legitimate interests. Specifically, we may use your
                    data
                    for the following purposes:
                    Providing and managing your Account.
                    Providing and managing your access to our Site.

                    to
                    enter into a contract with you).
                    Personalising and tailoring our products and services for you.
                    Replying to emails from you.
                    Supplying you with emails that you have opted into you may unsubscribe or opt-out at any time by

                    Analysing your use of our Site and gathering feedback to enable us to continually improve our Site

                    your user experience.
                    With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your data for marketing purposes
                    which may include contacting you by email and/or telephone with information, news and offers on our
                    products and services. We will not, however, send you any unsolicited marketing or spam and will

                <p>When you submit personal data via our site, you may be given options to restrict our use of your
                    data. In
                    particular, we aim to give you strong controls on our use of your data for direct marketing purposes
                    (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from us which you may do by unsubscribing

                    You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The

                    and
                    the Mailing Preference Service (“the MPS”). These may help to prevent you receiving unsolicited
                    marketing. Please note, however, that these services will not prevent you from receiving marketing
                    communications that you have consented to receiving.</p>
